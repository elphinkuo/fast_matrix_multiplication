## Why Strassen Algorithm is Slow on Modern Architectures

The Strassen algorithm, although theoretically faster than classical matrix multiplication with a complexity of \(O(n^{2.81})\) as opposed to \(O(n^3)\), often underperforms on modern computer architectures for several reasons:

### Cache Locality

1. **Poor Cache Utilization**: Strassen's algorithm involves many more additions and subtractions, and the matrices generated through its recursive steps don't necessarily fit well into cache. In contrast, classical matrix multiplication can be easily optimized to make good use of cache memory.

### Recursion Overhead

2. **Recursive Calls**: Strassen's algorithm is recursive in nature, and recursion introduces function call overhead.

### Small Matrix Handling

3. **Base Case Inefficiency**: For small matrices, the overhead of recursion and the increased number of additions can make Strassen's algorithm slower than the simple cubic algorithm. Usually, a hybrid approach is used where Strassen's is applied to large matrices, and classical multiplication is used for smaller ones, determined by a threshold.

### Additional Arithmetic Operations

4. **More Additions and Subtractions**: Strassen's algorithm reduces the number of multiplications at the expense of more addition and subtraction operations. The benefit of reduced multiplications is often outweighed by these extra operations.

### Numerical Stability

5. **Numerical Errors**: Strassen's algorithm can introduce more numerical errors compared to classical algorithms, although this may not be a 'speed' issue, it's often a consideration in scientific computing.


### Multi-core Processors and Hardware Accelerators

6. **Less Suited for Parallelization**: Modern hardware has multiple cores and often dedicated hardware for matrix operations (like GPUs). Classical matrix multiplication is easier to parallelize effectively on such hardware.

For these reasons, in the context of modern computer architectures, particularly those designed with linear algebra in mind, classical matrix multiplication algorithms, when well-optimized, often outperform Strassen's algorithm for practical problem sizes.
